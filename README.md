# WeatherBrain - A Weather Prediction Application
This is the Git repository for project group 8 in the course II1302 Projects and Project Methods.

Our goal is to create an application that can through machine learning predict upcoming weather / weather phenomenon’s. The application will receive its data from a simulated IoT-device that can measure certain weather parameters such as temperature, atmospheric pressure and humidity.

This project was develop using Microsoft Azure products. The products that were used in the project are **Virtual Machine** (Ubuntu), **SQL Database and Server**, **App Service** (website hosting), **IoT Hub** (intermediate point between IoT device and database) and **Storage Account**.

The weather prediction application will be used by researchers and regular people. The application will be able to give the stakeholders insight in upcoming weather using a prediction model. We believe that the prediction model that will be created will be able to predict the upcoming weather accurately. But as we know our product won’t be able to predict the weather better than other weather stations. Because of this our goal is not to be better but rather offer a solution. That solution is that most weather websites only offer weather reports for entire cities. Our product will be able to offer precise weather data at a specific position using the IoT device. This will give the user a chance to choose a location where to track and predict the upcoming weather.
